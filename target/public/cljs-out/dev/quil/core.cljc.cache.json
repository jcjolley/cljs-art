One of `:p2d`, `:p3d`, `:java2d`,\n                        `:opengl`, `:pdf`, `:svg`). Defaults to `:java2d`. `:dxf` renderer\n                        can't be used as sketch renderer. Use [[begin-raw]] method\n                        instead. In clojurescript only `:p2d` and `:p3d` renderers\n                        are supported.\n  * `:output-file`    - Specifies an output file path. Only used in `:pdf` and `:svg`\n                        modes. Not supported in clojurescript. When writing to a\n                        file, call [[exit]] at the end of the draw call to end\n                        the sketch and not write repeatedly to the file.\n  * `:title`          - A string which will be displayed at the top of\n                        the sketch window. Not supported in clojurescript.\n  * `:features`       - A vector of keywords customizing sketch behaviour.\n                        Supported features:\n    - `:keep-on-top`   - Sketch window will always be above other windows.\n                         Note: some platforms might not support always-on-top windows.\n                         Not supported in clojurescript.\n    - `:exit-on-close` - Shutdown JVM  when sketch is closed.\n                         Not supported in clojurescript.\n    - `:resizable`     - Makes sketch resizable. Not supported in clojurescript.\n    - `:no-safe-fns`   - Do not catch and print exceptions thrown inside functions\n                         provided to sketch (like draw, [[mouse-click]],\n                         [[key-pressed]] and others). By default all exceptions\n                         thrown inside these functions are caught. This prevents\n                         sketch from breaking when bad function was provided and\n                         allows you to fix it and reload it on fly. You can\n                         disable this behaviour by enabling `:no-safe-fns`\n                         feature. Not supported in clojurescript.\n    - `:present`       - Switch to present mode (fullscreen without borders, OS\n                         panels). You may want to use this feature together with\n                         `:size :fullscreen`. Not supported in ClojureScript. In\n                         ClojureScript fullscreen is enabled by pressing F11 and\n                         it's enabled on all sketches automatically.\n    - `:no-start`      - Disables autostart if sketch was created using defsketch\n                         macro.

Must be specified in sketch,\n                        may be omitted in defsketch. If omitted in defsketch,\n                        :host is set to the name of the sketch. If element with\n                        specified id is not found on the page and page is empty -\n                        new canvas element will be created.

The shapes must have been loaded\n  with [[load-shape]]. Processing currently works with SVG shapes\n  only. The `sh` parameter specifies the shape to display and the `x` and\n  `y` parameters define the location of the shape from its upper-left\n  corner. The shape is displayed at its original size unless the `width`\n  and `height` parameters specify a different size. The [[shape-mode]]\n  function changes the way the parameters work. A call to\n  `(shape-mode :corners)` for example, will change the width and height\n  parameters to define the x and y values of the opposite corner of\n  the shape.\n\n  Note complex shapes may draw awkwardly with the renderers `:p2d`, `:p3d`, and\n  `:opengl`.
